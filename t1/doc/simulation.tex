\subsection{Operating Point Analysis}

Table~\ref{tab:op} shows the simulated operating point results for the circuit under analysis.

\begin{table}[htb!]

  \begin{tabular}{|l|r|}
    \hline    
    {\bf Name} & {\bf Value [A or V]} \\ \hline

  \caption{Operating point results. A variable preceded by @ is of type {\em current}
    and expressed in Ampere; other variables are of type {\it voltage} and expressed in
    Volt.}
  \label{tab:op}
\end{table}

These results were produced using the \textit{Ngspice software}. In order for the \textit{software} to be able to recognise the Current-Controlled Voltage Source, defined in Figure \ref{fig2} as $H_c$, we had to add a new Independent Voltage Source with a voltage of 0V, which is also represented in \ref{fig2}.

To compare the results between the theoretical calculations and the simulation it's important to keep in mind that the current values and directions represented in \ref{fig2} by round arrows: $I_1$ $I_2$ $I_3$ e $I_4$ correspond, respectively, to the following values in the simulation data table (\ref{tab:op}): @r1[i], -@r2[i], -@id[current], -@r6[i] (or @r7[i], they're equivalent).


On a general basis, the values obtained by the simulation greatly resemble the ones obtained using the theoretical models and the application \textit{GNUOctave} to compute them.

In fact, by inspection it's possible to conclude that pratically all the values fit in the same magnitude as its correspondent. The biggest absolute difference reports to the voltage in node six, v(6): theoretical value - 4.0555787e+00 V, simulated value: 1.180782e+01 V. Being the biggest divergence, this represents an absolute error ($|theoretical - simulated|$) of 7.752241 V.
