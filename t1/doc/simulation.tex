\subsection{Operating Point Analysis}

Table~\ref{tab:op} shows the simulated operating point results for the circuit under analysis.

\begin{table}[htb!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|l|r|}
    \hline    
    {\bf Name} & {\bf Value [A or V]} \\ \hline
    \input{../sim/op_tab}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Operating point results. A variable preceded by @ is of type {\em current}
    and expressed in Ampere; other variables are of type {\it voltage} and expressed in
    Volt.}
  \label{tab:op}
\end{table}

These results were produced using the \textit{Ngspice software}. In order for the \textit{software} to be able to recognise the Current-Controlled Voltage Source, defined in Figure \ref{fig2} as $H_c$, we had to add a new Independent Voltage Source with a voltage of 0V, which is also represented in \ref{fig2}.
