% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit containing two independent sources, $V_a$ and $I_d$, one voltage-controlled source, $I_b$, one current-controlled source, $V_c$, connected to seven resistors. The circuit can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig1}.

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
