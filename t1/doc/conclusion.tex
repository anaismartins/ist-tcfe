\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}



In this laboratory assignment, the objective of analysing a circuit with several current and voltage sources (one linearly dependent and one independent of each) in parallel and in series with resistors has been
achieved.

Ideally, the current and voltage theoretical analysis (computed using \textit{GNUOctave}) should precisely resemble the circuit simulated by the \textit{Ngspice}. 

As seen in the previous section, it's possible to conclude that the simulations follow very closely the theoretical model used in the analysis: node and mesh analysis. In fact, for a circuit containing only linear components, the simulation values should not differ from the theoretically obtained ones.
