\section{Comparing the Results}
\label{sec:comparing}

In this section, we will be comparing the results obtained by both the Theoretical Analysis and the Simulation.

In the following tables and plots, we can observe the results already presented in previous sections now side by side, with the first table being the result of the simulation and the second one being the result from the theoretical analysis. These are displayed in this
way as a means of easier representation.

\subsection{Table Comparison}

\end{figure}

As we can see, the gain and input impedance values are preety much the same, which means the linear approximations required to do the theoretical analysis were accurate. However, the output impedance values are not even close, which suggests some sort of error in the process of calculation.

\end{figure}

The plots for the magnitude of the gain were very similar for lower frequencies, reaching essentially the same peak value at essentially the same frequency. However for higher frequencies the approximations no longer make sense, and the graphs might look similar, but differ in terms of slope. This might also explain why the gain's phase plots below differ:
