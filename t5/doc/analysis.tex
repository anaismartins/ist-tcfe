\section{Theoretical Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

We start off by analyzing the circuit at the central frequency, the geometric average between the lower and upper cut-off frequencies. In this case, the input impedance is given by the series of resistor $R_1$ and capacitor $C_1$ and the output impedance by the parallel of resistor $R_2$ and capacitor $C_2$. The gain is given by the quotient between $v_{out}$ and $v_{in}$, which is calculated taking into account the fact that this OP-AMP is a non-inverting amplifier. We get the results:

\begin{tabular}{|l|r|}
  \hline    
  {\bf Variable} & {\bf Value} \\ \hline
  \input{../mat/Teo1.tex}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

We then do the same type of analysis, but with a vector of frequencies, which means we calculate the gain for $f \in [10, 10^8] Hz$. We present its magnitude in dB and its phase in degrees.
