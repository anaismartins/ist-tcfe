\section{Simulation Analysis}
\label{sec:simulation}

We started out by doing a simulation analysis of the circuit that was present above. The OP-AMP used is a subcircuit composed of of 2 capacitors, 5 diodes, a voltage-controled voltage source, a current-controlled current source, 2 voltage-controlled current sources, an independent current source, a current-controled voltage source, 2 transistors, 9 resistors and 6 independent voltage sources, making it an OP-AMP in the model uA741.

In Figure \ref{fig:sim-gain}, the result for the gain for various frequencies is presented.

\end{figure}

It is obvious that we were able to come quite close to the requested gain, but our central frequency is not the desired one. In tables \ref{tab:gain-tab} and \ref{tab:freq-tab}, the relevant results from the the graph in Figure \ref{fig:sim-gain} are presented, which lets us know that the higher cut-off frequency is actually very close to the desired central frequency, which means that our gain is still mostly relevant at 1000Hz.

In Figure \ref{fig:sim-phase}, you are also able to see the phase of the circuit throughout the same range of frequencies.

\end{figure}

The discontinuance at around 10$^5$Hz is due to the fact that \textit{Ngspice}, the \textit{software} that was used for the simulation, automatically makes it so the values showed for the phase angle are between $\pi$ and -$\pi$, which lead to that. ESTAVA AQUI

\subsection{Output Impedance Calculation}

For us to be able to calculate the output impedance, we had to create a new circuit, similar to the original one. However, in this new circuit, that is displayed in Figure \ref{fig:circuit-out}, we have turned off the input voltage source and substituted the load for that same source.
