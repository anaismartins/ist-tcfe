\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In conclusion, it was verified that, while the theoretical predictions are good to have an understanding of how the components interact with each other, it only works under specific conditions - in this case for lower frequencies - whereas the simulation always gives a better approximation of reality. This happens because the theoretical analysis is an oversimplification of the real circuit, in this case, switching the transistors for all linear components, in such a way that the circuit still, ultimately works as a filter. However, as we could see in the graph for the gain in the theoretical analysis, the circuit used for the theoretical analysis works more closely as a highpass filter instead of a bandpass one.

As such, we do believe that the analysis of this amplifier circuit was successful, even considering the differences between the two analysis.
