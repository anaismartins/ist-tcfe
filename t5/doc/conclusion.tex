\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In conclusion, it was verified that the theoretical analysis and simulation were very similar, leading to the assessment that the OP-AMP is a considerably linear component. Furthermore, we also concluded that these approximations are much more viable for lower frequencies than for higher frequencies (starting at around 10$^4$Hz is where you can see the most difference).
Even thought the gain was not achieved in the desired central frequency, we were still able to come very close to the central frequency, which was just a few Hz after our upper cutoff frequency.

In general, the study of this circuit, which focused mainly on the usages of an OP-AMP, was a success.
