\section{Comparing the Results}
\label{sec:comparing}

In this section, we will be comparing the results obtained by both the Theoretical Analysis and the Simulation.

In the following tables and plots, we can observe the results already presented in previous sections now side by side, with the first table being the result of the simulation and the second one being the result from the theoretical analysis. These are displayed in this
way as a means of easier representation.
