In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation using the \textit{software Ngspice}. In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented, including an individual analysis for the envelope detector and the voltage regulator, ultimately, studying the same as in the Simulation Analysis section.
The results in each Analsysis are compared \ref{sec:comparing}.
The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
