\section{Simulation Analysis}
\label{sec:simulation}

In Figure \ref{fig:circuit-ngspice}, the circuit used by \textit{Ngspice} is displayed. Instead of the transformer, we use one voltage controlled voltage source and one current controlled current source to simulate an ideal transformer. Furthermore, we add a 0V voltage source between nodes 2 and 4 because \textit{Ngspice} needs it for the current source to work. Moreover, the diodes used are the default ones created by the \textit{software}.
