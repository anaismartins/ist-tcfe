\section{Comparing the Results}
\label{sec:comparing}

In this section, we will be comparing the results obtained by both the Theoretical Analysis and the Simulation.

\subsection{Results for the System at \textit{t $<$ 0}}

In the following tables, we can observe the results already presented in previous sections now side by side, with the first
2 tables being part of the Theoretical Analysis and the 3rd one being part of the Simulation. These are displayed in this
way as a means of easier representation.

\begin{table}[htb!]
  \begin{tabular}{|l|r|}
      \hline    
      {\bf Name} & {\bf Currents [A]} \\ \hline
      \input{../mat/t2-t1-currents.tex}
  \end{tabular}
\quad
  \begin{tabular}{|l|r|}
    \hline    
    {\bf Name} & {\bf Voltages [V]} \\ \hline
    \input{../mat/t2-t1-voltages.tex}
  \end{tabular}
\quad
  \begin{tabular}{|l|r|}
    \hline    
    {\bf Name} & {\bf Value [A or V]} \\ \hline
    \input{../sim/op_tab}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Results for the Circuit at $t<0$}
\end{table}

\subsection{Time- and Frequency-Dependent Analysis}

Lastly, here are the graphs we obtained by analysing the system side by side, Figures \ref{fig:sbs1}, \ref{fig:sbs2} and \ref{fig:sbs3}. It is clear that all of them are identical, which leads us to conclude, once more, that the study was succsseful.
