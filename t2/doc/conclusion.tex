\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}



In this laboratory assignment the objective of analysing a circuit with several current and voltage sources (two linearly
dependent and one independent) and a capacitor in parallel and in series with resistors has been
achieved.

The current and voltage theoretical analysis (computed using \textit{GNUOctave}) precisely resembles the
circuit simulated by the \textit{Ngspice}. 

As seen in the previous section, it's possible to conclude that the simulations follows very closely the theorical model
used in the analysis: the node analysis.

To conclude, we find that the study of the circuit we were present with was successful.
