\subsection{Operating Point Analysis - The Circuit for $t<0$}

Table~\ref{tab:sim1} shows the simulated operating point results for the circuit under analysis, for $t<0$.

\begin{table}[htb!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|l|r|}
    \hline    
    {\bf Name} & {\bf Value [A or V]} \\ \hline
    \input{../sim/op_tab}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Operating point results. A variable preceded by @ is of type {\em current}
    and expressed in Ampere; other variables are of type {\it voltage} and expressed in
    Volt.}
  \label{tab:sim1}
\end{table}

These results and the ones that follow in this section were produced using the \textit{Ngspice software}.

For this range of time, the circuit is time static, which means that the Capacitor C behaves as an open circuit. This is shown in Figure \ref{fig:sim1}.
As well as that modification, we also had to add a new Independent Voltage Source with a voltage of 0V whose current would be $I_d$, in order for \textit{Ngspice} to recognise the Current-Controlled Voltage Source, defined in Figure \ref{fig:sim1} as $H_d$. Bearing this in mind the Voltage Source was added between node 0 and a new node 9, with node 9 being placed between the GROUND and the first terminal of $R_6$.

\subsection{Operating Point Analysis - Finding the Inital Conditions}

In this section, we analyse the following circuit:

\begin{figure}[h] \centering

\caption{The original circuit with an added voltage source of value 0V.}
\label{fig:sim2}
\end{figure}

Once again, the 0V Source is added for Ngspice to be able to recognise $H_d$.
Analysing this circuit is useful for us to be able to find the inital conditions of the original circuit at $V_6$ and $V_8$, the nodes that the Capacitor is connected to. We need this information because, from now on, the analysis of the circuit will be time-dependent and we need to know the inital conditions for the circuit.

The results for the Operating Point Analysis are represented in Table \ref{tab:sim2}.

\begin{table}[htb!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|l|r|}
    \hline    
    {\bf Name} & {\bf Value [A or V]} \\ \hline
    \input{../sim/op2_tab}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Operating point results. A variable preceded by @ is of type {\em current}
    and expressed in Ampere; other variables are of type {\it voltage} and expressed in
    Volt.}
  \label{tab:sim2}
\end{table}

As expected, these results give us the values we were looking for: $V_6 = 8.683696V$ (which equals $V_6(t < 0) - V_8(t < 0)$), and $V_8 \approx 0$ (which, compared to the size of $V_6$, we can assume is actually 0).

\subsection{Transient Analysis - No Forced Frequency}

For our first time-dependent analysis, we analyse the original circuit in the interval $t \in [0, 20]ms$, with no forced frequency, adding onto it, once again, the 0V Source:

\begin{figure}[h] \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{t2-sim345.pdf}
\caption{The original circuit with an added voltage source of value 0V.}
\label{fig:sim345}
\end{figure}

This schematic of the circuit is the one that will also be followed in the next two sections.

For this analysis, we used the boundary conditions for $V_6$ and $V_8$ obtained in the previous section, with the AC Independent Voltage Source $V_s$ following a sinusoidal signal, displayed in Figure \ref{fig:sim345}. The result of the Transient Analysis made by \textit{Ngspice} is shown in Figure \ref{fig:sim-graph3}.

\begin{figure}[h] \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{../sim/trans3.pdf}
\caption{Voltage of $V_6$ vs. Time ($\in [0, 20]ms$) - Transient Analysis of the Original Circuit with No Forced Frequency}
\label{fig:sim-graph3}
\end{figure}

As expected, the voltage of $V_6$ decays exponentially, as the Capacitor stores more and more energy as time goes by.
